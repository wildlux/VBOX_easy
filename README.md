How to install virtualbox with official repository

Problem: I want to install software from default repository, and i follow page (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)
the process it's split into:
1) add repository with customize name of your distro.
2) add the key ( expose on the website then ok no problem)

Solution : i create a small software for customize setup in to any Linux Distro

Example : in Ubuntu i will lunch 
          ####  lsb_release -c | grep -i -u 'codename' 
          but i need also specidic name then i take this string and i replace with onother string and trim the rest.

Thank you for reading this!
